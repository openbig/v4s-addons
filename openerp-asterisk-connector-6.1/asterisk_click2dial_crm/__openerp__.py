    This module adds CRM-specific features to the asterisk_click2dial module.

    It adds 2 features :

    First, when you do a click2dial, OpenERP will propose you to create an
    outbound phone call in the CRM ; if you answer 'Yes', it will create the phone
    call in the CRM and open it in a new tab. If some users don't want to be asked
    to create a phone call in the CRM each time they do a click2dial, you
    should disable the corresponding option in the 'Telephony' tab of the 'User'
    form.

    Second, when you receive a phone call and run the wizard "Open calling partner",
    if the partner is found in OpenERP, you will see a button that proposes to create
    an inbound phone call in the CRM.

    This module has been initially developped by Zikzakmedia and has been enhanced by Akretion.

    A detailed documentation for the OpenERP-Asterisk connector is available on the Akretion Web site : http://www.akretion.com/en/products-and-services/openerp-asterisk-voip-connector
